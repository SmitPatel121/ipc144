1. A double represent around 2 raised to the power 64 different values. So, 10.12 is a   different case as each encodable value is some 53 bit integer times some power of 2. 
When it is printed with accurate decimal precession, its rounded difference from 10.12 shows up. 
    10.10 = 10.100000000000000
    10.12 = 10.119999999999999
    10.15 = 10.150000000000000
If we try to find the exact value then it will show the 10.119999999999999 because of lack of bites, for solving this we have to use different character like “long double”.




2. The possible values that can be returned based on the following statements using the modulus operator are as follows:  
    a) 0, 1.
    b) 0, 1, 2.
    c) [0,99]   or 0 to 99.

3. Discard.


4.It is often a best practice to convert floating-point values to integers when performing arithmetic operations because double can just give best precision a part whose denominator is a power of two. At the point when you say 0.1 in a double, you do not get 1/10, as 1/10 isn't a fraction, whose denominator is any power of two. You get the division that is nearest to 1/10 that has a power of two in the denominator. And also, to avoid any kind of error in our program it is best practice to first convert floating-point valves to integers.
